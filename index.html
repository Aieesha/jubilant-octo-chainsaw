                    <p>There’s no universal rule to life. No textbook to abide by in order to consider having lived one. There are no checklists to follow, nor are there any expectations to meet. You could spend all your life a hippie traveling through the cities and the jungles or you could spend your life entirely trapped in your professional workspace. Or you could choose to strike a balance.

                        The power of defining what your life means is entirely in your hands.

                    <h2>LIFE </h2>
                    <p>In one simple statement, Life is what you make of it.<br>

                        For some people, life is love. For others, it’s happiness.
                        
                        For some people, life is all about traveling. For others, it’s about learning to enjoy their own company.
                        
                        For some people, life is all about achievements. For others, it’s all about experiences.

                        <p>
                        
                        Life means different things to different people. Some like it, some don’t care, others loathe it.
                        
                        The thing about life is that it’s incredibly malleable. It’s entirely open to interpretation. You can shape it, mould it, guide it and channel it to the direction you want it to head. You can make it mean something at one point and change it to mean something else in the future.
                        
                        Life itself doesn’t come with any concrete definitions about it’s nature. What we go through from the moment we’re born to the moment we die is life. This could be a lot of different things to a lot of different people.</p>

                    <p>Life is nothing but a bittersweet agglomerate of experiences. There are good ones and then there are bad ones. Every experience teaches us something, it leaves behind a nostalgia within us.

                        It shapes our being, the way we think and perceive the world then on for the rest of our lives. It teaches us to absorb something from everything and also ‘let go' of everything.
                        
                        Experiences is all what life is about. You cannot touch it, but still it is all you have and it is the only thing you are made up of.
